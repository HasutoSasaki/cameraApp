# Core Requirements

- The end goal is stability, speed and great user experience.

## Code Quality Requirements

- Follow standard TypeScript conventions and best practices
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious implementations
- Write unit tests for core functionality using `vitest`
  - Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) in tests
  - No need for explicit comments like "// arrange", "// act", or "// assert"
- Keep functions focused and manageable (generally under 50 lines)
- Use error handling patterns consistently
